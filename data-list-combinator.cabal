-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            Data.List replacement with little recursion

-- A longer description of the package.
description:

    as little recursion as reasonably possible. The intent is
    to be correct, to have performance vaguely comparable with
    the old implementation, and to be maximally productive.
