--
-- This re-implementation of 'Data.List' was inspired 
-- by working with Bart Massey, Jamey Sharp and Jules
-- Kongslie's generalized 'fold'.  
--
-- The documentation and a bit of the implementation are
-- either taken from or inspired by the 'base' 'Data.List'
-- implementation of GHC. However, this is not a
-- lightly-hacked 'Data.List':
-- 
--   * The documentation has been substantially rewritten to
--   provide a more accurate description
--   
--   * The primitives have been almost entirely
--   reimplemented, with the goal of eliminating as many
--   recursive constructions as possible.  Most primitives
--   are now implemented in terms of each other; the
--   remaining few are implemented in terms of a generalized
--   'unfold' operation and a 'fold' operation derived from
--   it.
-- 
--   * The handling of primitives involving numbers has
--   changed to use 'Integer' rather than 'Int' as the
--   default type. This future-proofs the library and
--   makes the Laws of these operations easier to use,
--   presumably at the expense of performance.
--   
--   * A few new primitives have been added.
--
-- The result of this work is a library that is likely to be
-- less performant than the GHC 'base' library. However, it
-- is hopefully easier to understand, verify and maintain.
-- 
-- Every function described here is maximally productive,
-- unless otherwise specified. Informally, this means that
-- the result of the function will be built up in such a way
-- that each piece will be ready for consumption as early as
-- logically possible.
-- 
-- Each function has "laws" that are intended to specify its behavior.
-- The laws are currently only intended to cover the case of finite lists;
-- they may or may not work in the presence of infinite lists even if
-- the function being specified is maximally productive.

-- | Given an initial left and right accumulator and a
-- function that steps the accumulators forward from the
-- left and right as with 'fold', keep stepping until the
-- function indicates completion by returning 'Nothing' on
-- the right. /O(n)/ where /n/ is the number of unfolding
-- steps, plus the cost of evaluating the folding function.
-- 
-- This abstraction of 'fold' is a bidirectional
-- generalization of 'unfoldr': both are written as
-- 'unfold's.
unfold :: ((l, r) -> (l, Maybe r)) -> (l, r) -> (l, r)
unfold f (l, r) =

-- XXX Need to write laws for this.

-- | Given a function that accepts an element and a left and
-- right context and produces a new left and right context,
-- and given an initial left and right context and a list,
-- run the function on each element of the list with the
-- appropriate context.
-- 
-- The 'fold' operation generalizes a number of things from
-- 'Data.List', including 'foldl' and 'foldr'. It works by
-- allowing `f` to work with both state accumulated from the
-- left and state built up from the right simultaneously.
-- 
-- @'fold' f (l, r)@ is fully lazy if `f` is fully lazy
-- on `l` and `r`, strict if at most one of `l` and `r` is
-- strict, and is bottom if both `l` and `r` are strict.
-- 
-- One can think of 'fold' as processing each element of its
-- list input with a function that receives left context
-- calculated from its predecessors and a right context
-- calculated from its successors. As one traverses the list
-- and examines these elements, the function is run to produce
-- these outputs.
-- 
-- There is probably a need for versions of these functions
-- strict in the left context: call it 'fold'' .
-- 
-- Compare this 'fold' with Noah Easterly's "bifold" discussed
-- a while back on Haskell-Cafe
-- (<http://haskell.1045720.n5.nabble.com/Bifold-a-simultaneous-foldr-and-foldl-td3285581.html>). That
-- fold is identical to this one (up to trivial signature
-- differences). (I do not understand whether Henning
-- Theielemann's "foldl'r" is the same. There is some
-- interesting discussion of "Q" from Backus in that thread
-- that I would like to absorb someday.)  In any case, I
-- think there is enough novelty in the use of 'fold' in
-- this library to be worth paying attention to. /O(n)/ plus
-- the cost of evaluating the folding function.
