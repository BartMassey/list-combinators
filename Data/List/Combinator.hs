-- This first bit is Bart Massey, Jamey Sharp and Jules
-- Kongslie's generalized fold.  This fold generalizes a
-- number of things from 'Data.List', including 'foldl' and
-- 'foldr'. It works by allowing `f` to work with both state
-- accumulated from the left and state built up from the
-- right simultaneously.

-- 'fold' is fully lazy if `f` is fully lazy
-- on `l` and `r`, strict if at most one of `l` and `r` is
-- strict, and is bottom if both `l` and `r` are strict.

-- One can think of 'fold' as processing each element of its
-- list input with a function that receives left context
-- calculated from its predecessors and a right context
-- calculated from its successors. As one traverses the list
-- and examines these elements, the function is run to produce
-- these outputs.

-- There is probably a need for versions of these functions
-- strict in the left context: call it fold' .

-- Compare this work with the "bifold" discussed a while back
-- on Haskell-Cafe:
-- 
--    http://haskell.1045720.n5.nabble.com/
--           Bifold-a-simultaneous-foldr-and-foldl-td3285581.html
-- 
-- That fold is identical to this one (up to trivial signature
-- differences). However, I think the subsumption results here
-- are new.  There is some interesting discussion of "Q" from
-- Backus that I would like to absorb someday.

-- | Given a function that accepts an element and a left and
-- right context and produces a new left and right context,
-- and given an initial left and right context and a list,
-- run the function on each element of the list with the
-- appropriate context.
